  Hi, my name's Jugal and I'm a Master's student at The Pennsylvania State University. Currently, I'm working as a learning assistant for the course CMPSC443: Computer and Network Security. Before starting my master's journey, I worked as a technology analyst at Goldman Sachs for 2 years. I'm mostly interested in systems development i.e. data systems, operating systems, network systems, or systems field in general.

          Taco-DB is a Postgres-like database system. The framework included writing a low-level file and datapage interface, bypassing OS buffering for optimized performace. We then built the `table` interface on top of the the datapage/file interface. We also added additional features building like B+ Trees on top of tables, a query execution interface for the database and query optimization for select queries.

          Worked on a distributed key-value store in Golang. Implemented the Single-Decree Paxos algorithm for consensus amongst peers. The distributed key-value store implements a state machine on a replicated log for resilient and fault-tolerant data store.

          Built a simple operating system with a custom bootloader. Implemented page tables, interrupt descriptor table (IDT) with custom interrupts, global descriptor table (GDT), APIC timer, and setup system calls. Ported the MiniOS to Xen. Initialized and demonstrated the use of Hypercalls and grant tables in MiniOS.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
